# Electronic Thai Pad

A Thai pad that records and displays how hard you hit it with a strip of LEDs.

**What is a thai pad?**
- A thai pad is a handheld pad for kicking and punching
- However, it can be hard to guage how hard you are hitting to track your improvement

**What this electronic thai pad does**
- This project embedded an IMU (accelerometer) and a number of piezo sensors within a thai pad to detect the strengh of hits.
- It then uses an LED strip surrounding the pad to display visually the strength of hits
- Additionally, aim is very important, so the 5 piezo sensors, spread in a pentagon, can be used to highlight where on the pad your strike lands in order to help you center your following strikes

**Why I made this proejct**
As a fourth degree black belt, I value every source of feedback, but objective feedback can be difficult and expensive to acquire, so this is a cheap and low cost way to acquire objective feedback on my techniques.

## Pictures
### Full Project
- I would provide a 3d model, but it would just be an image of a thai pad, this system is mean to be fully embedded. However, below is a sketch of the sensor positioning
- Note: These are meant to be flexible as there are many variation of thai pad designs.

### Wiring Diagram
- As the thai pad is rather large, a PCB will not work, instead I have attached a wiring diagram.
